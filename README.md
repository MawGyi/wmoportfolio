# Win Maw Oo — Portfolio

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a Technical Business Analyst.

## About This Project

After 12+ years in the tech industry, I wanted a clean space to highlight my journey — from software development to business analysis. Built with Next.js and styled with that sleek dark mode aesthetic we all love.

## What's Inside

- **Projects** — Real work I've done at ACE Data Systems and beyond
- **Experience** — My career timeline from developer to BA
- **Skills** — Tools and methodologies I work with daily
- **Certifications** — Including my recent KodeKloud DevOps cert 🎉

## Tech I Used

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Dark/Light mode with next-themes

## Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MawGyi/wmoportfolio.git
cd wmoportfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're good to go.

## Want to Customize?

All the content lives in `src/app/page.tsx` — just update the data objects there and you're set. Colors can be tweaked in `src/app/globals.css`.

Built with ☕ and late nights in Bangkok.
